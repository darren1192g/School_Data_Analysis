# analysis
  To compare district vs charter schools in many of the topics that are put forth here should have been done differntly.
We can get a general overview of the types of schools, but we should have seperated the school into their respecive catagory. We can see that one school a lone could carry the avg. higher in a catagory but might not be true to the rest of the school. This can skew the data one way or the other. We can see that the data that is shown there is small differentce in the chater schools vs the public schools in education grade avg. We can see that school budget does not make one school have higher avg. that any other school.
